# import module_name 
# from module_name import function_name 
# from module_name import function_name as fn 
# import module_name as mn 
# from module_name import *

import title # Import title.py

from title import favorite_book # from module_name import function_name 
from title import favorite_book as fb # from module_name import function_name as fn 
import title as fb # import module_name as mn
