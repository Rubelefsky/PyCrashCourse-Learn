# page 117 - Introducing while loops

current_number = 1 # assign current_number to 1
while current_number <= 5: # While current_number is <= 5
    print(current_number) # print current_number (inside while loop)
    current_number += 1 # add 1 to current_number (inside while loop)

    # += is shorthand for current_number = current_number + 1
