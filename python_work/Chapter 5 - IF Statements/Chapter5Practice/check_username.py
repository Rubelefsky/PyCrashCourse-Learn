    if users not in current_users:
        print(f"That username {users} is available.") # print - brandon and smith

# Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. 
# If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. 
# If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
# Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted. 
# (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)
